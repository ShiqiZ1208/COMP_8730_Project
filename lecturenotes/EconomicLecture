Welcome to your first lecture on microeconomics! Microeconomics is a branch of economics that focuses on the behavior and decision-making of individual consumers, businesses, and industries. It looks at how these smaller units of the economy make choices about what to buy, what to produce, and how much to charge for goods and services.

One of the most fundamental concepts in microeconomics is the idea of supply and demand. Demand refers to how much of a product people are willing to buy at different prices. Typically, as prices go down, people want to buy more, and when prices rise, they buy less. On the other hand, supply refers to how much of a product producers are willing to make and sell at different prices. Usually, producers are willing to supply more when the price is higher because they can make more profit. The interaction between supply and demand helps set the price of goods in the market, and when the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, we reach a state called equilibrium.

Another important concept in microeconomics is opportunity cost, which is the idea that when we make a choice, we are giving up something else. For instance, if you decide to spend money on a concert ticket, the opportunity cost might be not being able to spend that money on something else, like a new pair of shoes or saving it for later.

Finally, microeconomics looks at how businesses and consumers respond to price changes, a concept known as elasticity. If a small price change causes a big change in the amount of a product people want to buy, it’s considered "elastic." If demand stays mostly the same despite price changes, it’s considered "inelastic."

Overall, microeconomics helps us understand how people and businesses make decisions and how these decisions affect the economy at a smaller scale.
